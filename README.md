# Basis Set Simulation
# This project simulates semi-LASER basis sets using shaped refocusing pulses, creating the .basis files necessary for conventional fitting software. This simulation helps in the accurate analysis of spectroscopic data.
# It utilizes functions from [FID-A] (https://www.opensourceimaging.org/project/fid-a-advanced-processing-and-simulation-of-mr-spectroscopy/)  and [Osprey] (https://schorschinho.github.io/osprey/).
