# Description
This project simulates semi-LASER basis sets using shaped refocusing pulses, creating the .basis files necessary for conventional fitting software. This simulation helps in the accurate analysis of spectroscopic data.

It utilizes functions from [FID-A](https://www.opensourceimaging.org/project/fid-a-advanced-processing-and-simulation-of-mr-spectroscopy/) and [Osprey](https://schorschinho.github.io/osprey/).

# Installation
To clone the repository, run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/arcj-hub/BasisSetSimulation.git`

`cd BasisSetSimulation`

Required Dependencies: FID-A

# Usage
To simulate a basis set, run the following script after setting all the required input parameters

`run_simLASERShaped_fast_JNZ.m`

# Output

The output is a .basis file compatible with conventional fitting software. The pdf file includes simulated spectra based on the specified parameters and pulse sequences.
