% USAGE:
% out=run_simPressShaped_fast(spinSys);
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This script simulates a PRESS experiment with fully shaped refocusing 
% pulses. Coherence order filtering is employed to only simulate desired signals
% This results in a 4x speed up compared to phase cycling (see deprecated run_simSemiLASERShaped_fast_phCyc.m)
% Furthermore, simulations are run at various locations in space to account for the 
% within-voxel spatial variation of the metabolite signal.  Summation 
% across spatial positions is performed. The MATLAB parallel computing toolbox 
% (parfor loop) was used to accelerate the simulations.  Acceleration 
% is currently performed in the direction of the slice selective pulse along
% the x-direction, but this can be changed.  Up to a factor of 12 acceleration
% can be achieved using this approach. To achieve 
% faster perfomance compared to the original 'run_simSemiLASER_shaped.m' function,
% this code uses the method described by Yan Zhang et al. Med Phys 2017;44(8): 
% 4169-78.  Some additional acceleration is currently performed using parfor 
% loops in both x and y directions.  To enable the use of the MATLAB
% parallel computing toolbox, initialize the multiple worked nodes using
% "matlabpool size X" where "X" is the number of available processing
% nodes.  If the parallel processing toolbox is not available, then replace
% the "parfor" loop with a "for" loop.

% INPUTS:
% To run this script, there is technically only one input argument:
% spinSys           = spin system to simulate 
%
% However, the user should also edit the following parameters as 
% desired before running the function:
% refocWaveform     = name of refocusing pulse waveform.
% refTp             = duration of refocusing pulses[ms]
% Bfield            = Magnetic field strength in [T]
% Npts              = number of spectral points
% sw                = spectral width [Hz]
% Bfield            = magnetic field strength [Tesla]
% lw                = linewidth of the output spectrum [Hz]
% thkX              = slice thickness of x refocusing pulse [cm]
% thkY              = slice thickness of y refocusing pulse [cm]
% fovX              = full simulation FOV in the x direction [cm]
% fovY              = full simulation FOV in the y direction [cm]
% nX                = number of spatial grid points to simulate in x-direction
% nY                = number of spatial grid points to simulate in y-direction
% taus              = vector of pulse sequence timings  [ms]
% refPhCyc1         = vector of phase cycling steps for 1st refocusing pulse [degrees]
% refPhCyc2         = vector of phase cycling steps for 2nd refocusing pulse [degrees]
%
